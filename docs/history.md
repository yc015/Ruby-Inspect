# History of Ruby

Ruby is created by Yukihiro Matsumoto and first publicly released on December 21, 1995 with version 0.95. The compilation model of Ruby is half-compiled and half-interpreted like Java. The Ruby program is first compiled into the bytecodes, which are later interpreted in the Ruby’s virtual machine (e.g. [YARV](http://www.atdot.net/yarv/)) [1].

# What makes Ruby special?

Unlike the other languages that optimize on the machine’s performance, Ruby is created as a productive tool for the human developers [2]. There are [companies](https://www.indeed.com/q-Ruby-On-Rails-jobs.html) hiring the Ruby Engineers for web applications development using [Ruby on rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), a web application framework written in Ruby.
