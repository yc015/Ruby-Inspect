# Deep vs Shallow copying of objects

Ruby makes the shallow copy of objects by default. For example, we can create a shallow copy of an array using its clone method.

**shallow_copy.rb**
```ruby
original_salad = ["Ham", "Potatoes", "Lettuce"]
copy_salad = original_salad.clone
copy_salad[0].chop! # Remove the last character from String "Ham" in copy_salad

puts copy_salad.to_s 
puts original_salad.to_s
```

Source code: [https://github.com/yc015/Ruby-Inspect/blob/main/src/shallow_copy.rb](https://github.com/yc015/Ruby-Inspect/blob/main/src/shallow_copy.rb)

The codes above will print:  

    ["Ha", "Potatoes", "Lettuce"]
    ["Ha", "Potatoes", "Lettuce"]

The first String element `"Ham"` in both original and copied arrays are changed. Thus, Ruby creates a shallow copy of the array, and there are copied references to the same String objects inside the copied array.

We can make a deep copy in Ruby using the Marshal moduleâ€™s load and dump functions.

**deep_copy.rb**
```ruby
original_salad = ["Ham", "Potatoes", "Lettuce"]
copy_salad = Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(original_salad))
copy_salad[0].chop! # Remove the last character from String "Ham" in copy_salad

puts copy_salad.to_s 
puts original_salad.to_s
```

Source code: [https://github.com/yc015/Ruby-Inspect/blob/main/src/deep_copy.rb](https://github.com/yc015/Ruby-Inspect/blob/main/src/deep_copy.rb)

The codes above will print:  

    ["Ha", "Potatoes", "Lettuce"]
    ["Ham", "Potatoes", "Lettuce"]

Using the Marshal.load and Marshal.dump, we create a deep copy of the array. The first element of the `original_salad` array is unaffected when we change its deep copy `copy_salad`.
